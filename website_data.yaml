    ## Editor's Note

    Ten years ago, Project RISHI, Rural India Social and Health Improvement, was founded at UCLA by Dr. Eri Srivatsan and four of the students working under him. Today, it is a 10-chapter, national nonprofit organization that implements projects aiming to promote sustainable development in rural India. This series is a survey of the work that six members of the UCLA chapter of Project RISHI completed between Sept. 9 through Sept. 17 in a village called Vadamanappakkam, located in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.


    Radio reporter Jonaki Mehta, photographer Sonja Bartlett and an external translator, Ravindranath Chandran, spent nine days in Vadamanappakkam covering the progress and effectiveness of Project RISHI’s initiatives and exploring the complexities of this rural village and its residents.


    This project was made possible by the [Bridget O’Brien Scholarship Foundation](http://rememberingbridget.com/), which has funded UCLA’s student journalists for eight years to cover stories of a global reach and local impact.

    - title: CASTING A LINE
      description: >

        In the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu lies a village called Vadamanappakkam, or Manappakkam for short. Tamil Nadu is known for its welfare programs, aimed at the most economically disadvantaged communities in the state.


        A society that relies primarily on agricultural farming and weaving, Manappakkam is a small village with complex socioeconomic dynamics, yet is also closely knit.


        Wanting to give back to his ancestral village,  Srivatsan began Project RISHI with four other students in hopes of introducing sustainable development to Manappakkam, and in turn, other villages in India. The ways in which the state government segments its demographics and the populations that require welfare programs is through the caste system, an ancient system of social classification. In this village, as in many other rural villages of India, the geographic distribution of its population is determined by caste, and thus economic status and profession.


        This episode expands further on how this system has residual effects in this community, and how that interfaces with nonprofit work.  While government aid to low-income communities is vital, nonprofit work comes into play where government aid cannot.

          caption: This is a map of Vadamanappakkam. In the past, members of the castes after which the streets are named lived on the streets designated to their caste. Today, there is only one Brahmin left living in the village, who is a relative of Dr. Eri S. Srivatsan, a professor of surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and his family. The castes intermix more, but the Scheduled Caste area, which is in the outer regions of the village, are the lowest economic status of the village’s members. The distance to the projects implemented by Project RISHI in the village, such as restrooms and the clinic, was a complaint that two of the families in the scheduled caste area mentioned.

A paid doctor is assigned by the nonprofit to work at the clinic at most three times a week, for two hours each day. In the nine days that Project RISHI was in the village this summer, he only came to the clinic once.

Over 65 eye surgeries have been performed for residents of Vadamanappakkam since the eye camps began being held here.

        MEHTA 1: This is Vadamanappakkam, a rural village tucked away in the Tiruvannamalai district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, where the heat is sweltering nearly year round and the cows graze in slowly withering grasses with cawing crows on their backs. [AMBI of birds/rooster/cows] The near-5,000 residents of Vadamanappakkam – or Manappakkam, for short – have risen well before the sun to begin their day. Some head to one of the village’s many Hindu temples for their daily worship, while others prepare for the day’s work.

        It’s here that Project RISHI, a student organization founded at UCLA, first began to work toward its aim of sustainable development in rural India. RISHI stands for Rural India Social and Health Improvement. The student-run nonprofit has created concrete change in Manappakkam through various projects, but the lack of continuity in its presence and factors that are a result of RISHI being an outside agent based abroad also pose constraints. The group has also come head-to-head with complex cultural issues such as the residual effects of the caste system in India, which is an ancient system of social classification. While some progress has been made due to its presence, other complexities are often overlooked.

        For example, the scheduled caste areas as they are labeled by the state government are composed of the most poverty-stricken communities in the village. They are geographically separated from the central town where the businesses, clinic and restrooms are located. And many of the tacit boundaries that stand between higher castes like Brahmins and the most backward caste, or MBC, are a hurdle of their own kind. I asked one of the members of the scheduled caste whether or not she has attempted to express her needs to Project RISHI or any authorities. Mrs. Munuswamy, age 66, responded with the following.

        MUNUSWAMY 1: Whenever we go there to talk to Dr. Srivatsan (Dr. Eri S. Srivatsan) or his family, there are already a lot of other people surrounding them, so we cannot approach them. It's a question of the highest caste, Brahmin. How can someone like me from a lower caste approach him directly? It’s a mental block.

        MEHTA 2: A number of the projects that the group has put forth have stood in the village for years, but sustainability has been difficult to attain. The group attends to the needs of the village as the society changes, which is an issue that Professor Robert Spich, senior lecturer of global economics and management at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, has encountered.

        SPICH 1:  I think underestimating the complexity of the issues is a problem nonprofits organizations tend to have. Another related issue is that these societies – well all societies, are changing. These societies are not static, people might say, “Oh, villages are static, nothing changes.” That’s just not true today.

        MEHTA 3: RISHI’s goals do involve addressing that the village is changing. A part of its methodology involves finding out the particular desires of each village it works with.

        PURUSHOTHAMAN 1: Dr. Srivatsan used to visit the village on and off, fairly often. And during his visits, he was told by the villagers that there was a dire need for a hospital here because there is nothing close-by. And heeding to their requests, this dispensary was built.

        MEHTA 4: D. Purushothaman is a local man who is paid by Project RISHI to manage the clinic that they  built in 2008 after the village residents expressed the need for local medical care. Many of the villagers use the clinic as a meeting point, or accompany their elders at times when they feel an ache from bending over in the fields or a persisting cough, for example. While the doctor is only assigned to come, at most, three times a week for two hours each day, the local population of the village relies on the clinic on most days of the week for access to medication.The clinic also serves as a site for occasional medical camps such as eye camps or dental camps that Project RISHI arranges through private hospitals that provide pro bono work in underserved communities

        Project RISHI, however, is not limited to this village and its projects. RISHI now has 10 total chapters throughout 10 universities in the U.S. with an aim for using methods of sustainable development through projects to provide necessities like restrooms, clean water and access to education. Each chapter works in a different village in India with its own specific needs. Manappakkam continues to be the village the UCLA chapter works with. The village’s local government, which is called a panchayat, is led by a 44-year-old president, P. Thulasiraman, who spoke to us about the village’s demographics.

        THULASIRAMAN 1: The number of working people in the village are 2,500, and the total population is around 5,000.

        MEHTA 5: Agricultural farming and weaving are the main professions here, but as weaving becomes more advanced on an industrial level and monsoon seasons run dryer and dryer, the prospects for both professions are dwindling.

        THULASIRAMAN 2: The four communities living here are Yadavas, Mudaliars, Vanniyars, and Sengunthars.

        MEHTA 6: These four communities make up the “backwards class,” or BC, and MBC within the caste system that make up the population of the village. Manappakkam was once a village whose citizens were geographically divided by the caste to which they belonged, with streets named after the caste who belonged there. Today the divisions are less stark but still present.

        THULASIRAMAN 3: And then the SCs, meaning the “scheduled castes.” Scheduled castes and “scheduled tribes” are people who have been deprived of facilities that other castes enjoy. They are the economically and socially backward and downtrodden communities.

        MEHTA 7: The caste system is an extremely complex hierarchical system that is slowly fading in India at large, but its residual effects and resulting social norms still exist in most rural areas. The “backwards class,” or the BC, and the “most backwards class” or MBC, were historically segregated and granted far fewer resources and facilities relative to the higher castes that fall into the “other castes” sector of the caste system. The most marginalized communities within the caste system are the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, which make up nearly 17 percent and 9 percent respectively of India’s population. We noticed that the local high school kept records of the  students by caste.

        THULASIRAMAN 4: These demarcations on the board for the castes that you saw in the school have been required by the government because the government of Tamil Nadu bases its grants to the school and the provision of other facilities on the basis of the caste difference. This is because of the large economic disparity between the castes.

        MEHTA 8: Mrs. Munuswamy, who spoke earlier about difficulties breaching the informal caste boundaries, also mentioned other hurdles that she and her family face that are indirectly related to caste.

        MUNUSWAMY 2: The restrooms built by RISHI are also too far away for us to reach and water access is a problem because of how far away we live from tanks in the village. We also want our grandson to attend kindergarten, but we can’t afford school uniforms, so he will just have to wait to go to the government-run elementary school when he turns 5. It’s too expensive.

        MEHTA 9: However, Latha Krishnan, who is a village resident and serves as a primary liaison for the students while they visit, explains that the youth of the village is changing such dynamics slowly.

        KRISHNAN 1: The youth of the village, they gather together to help a person in distress. If there is a need, such as an emergency, or somebody’s sister is getting married, or there is a sudden requirement for money, they will pool together whatever they have and come forward to help the person.

        MEHTA 10: And though the MBC and BC groups as well as the village at large lack access to resources and education, there are several welfare schemes in place to uplift the lower castes out of poverty. These include providing bicycles for students beginning in the 11th grade, one free meal for students provided in school, or the famous “Amma canteen” program introduced by Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram, or “Amma,” as she is called, which means “mother.” Palagummi Sainath, former rural affairs editor of The Hindu, a major national newspaper in India, spoke to me about Tamil Nadu’s welfare programs.

        SAINATH 1: Look at, say, for instance bicycles is one, the Amma canteen is an incredible...that was a brain wave. I mean, I think that’s been a huge draw. It shows you how much residual hunger there is in the Indian population. Tamil Nadu is one of the better-off states when it comes to education, and educational levels and quality. So that should give you an idea of what’s happening in the rest of the country. The level of welfarism in these states, the level of demands and expectations of the public are much higher than you would find in, say, Bihar or U.P. (Uttar Pradesh).

        MEHTA 11: While government programs have an impact on the reduction of poverty in Tamil Nadu, their efforts are generalized to the struggles faced by the lower castes in the entire state. What governments cannot do is listen to the specific, most pressing needs of the people directly. This is a gap that leaves room for nongovernment organizations and nonprofit organizations to step in and take a more personalized approach to the specific demands of each community.

        VEMBUSUBRAMANIAN 2: If you were to compare, like, Project RISHI’s work to something bigger like Red Cross or something like that, Red Cross is focused more on just helping the macro environment in the country, help everyone get out of poverty or whatever. But that can sometimes ignore, like, the actual desires of the people. I think working with a small village and each chapter working with a small village helps, kind of more focus on the actual needs of the people.

        MEHTA 12: That was Mohini Vembusubramanian, one of the six members of Project RISHI’s UCLA Chapter who visited Vadamanappakkam this summer. They visited this year to follow up on one of their past projects and to make new observations for future ones.

        In the next episode, we explore the difficulties RISHI has faced in past projects and their efforts towards a new approach.

        (Music by Tony Boardman)

        *Corrections: It was previously stated that the group only completed 25 of 88 surveys they aimed to complete. Project RISHI has informed us that this number may not be accurate as some homes had more than one cookstoves, so the total number of surveys is less than that. The total number of cookstoves sold is 88, not the total number of surveys.*

        In the first part of their trip, four Project RISHI members performed a skit on handwashing to students at the local high school in order to teach students about the importance of handwashing and hygiene. This demonstration was held in response to the deficiencies of their last project that attempted to address hygiene.


        In addition to exploring past projects, this episode traces Dr. Eri Srivatsan's journey from the outskirts of the village to America, and how his determination for giving back to his ancestral village translated into the UCLA chapter of Project RISHI. We also discuss the evolving needs of the community and how a nonprofit like Project RISHI deals with such changes.

It appeared that while some of the elementary school children use the RISHI-built bathrooms in their school, the high school students only use the government restrooms, or none at all. They also pointed to an outdoor area in the school yard, suggesting that many of the boys especially openly urinate and defecate.

They transcribed and translated “Chotha Bheem,” a popular children’s television show in India, into English.

        MEHTA 1: During the first part of their trip, four members of Project RISHI performed a skit to groups of schoolchildren in the village to demonstrate the importance of handwashing. Health and hygiene have been central goals of RISHI’s past projects from the beginning, with the medical clinic being one of the earliest and ongoing projects that addresses health in many aspects. Dr. Eri Srivatsan, whose ancestral home stood where the medical clinic is today, faced many of the challenges that lack of access to basic needs creates when he lived in a town in the outskirts of the village called Ranipet. From his own experiences and the hardships he faced, he felt that he wanted to help his ancestral village in any way he could once he found success in the United States.

        SRIVATSAN 1: I mean I came from a lower-middle class family at that time. I was the fifth child of six, so (we were) living in a small place. Room like this, kitchen and a small bathroom. And so we've come a long way. And most of the time, I had even the dhoti (traditional Hindu male clothing garment). And of course sandals, sometimes. I don't know if I had sandals until sixth or seventh grade – no sandals either. Local high school. So I went to the city, Madras. 12th grade. Everything was in English. It was difficult.

        MEHTA 2: Srivatsan was the first to leave Ranipet, where he spent most of his childhood. He went to Madras, or Chennai as it is now called, to work toward a graduate degree.

        SRIVATSAN 2: I was one of the first ones to come from Ranipet. First ones, to go there (to Chennai). It was difficult. I went there and I cried. ( The city is) a huge place. But I cried. The day I went there, I thought, "Why did I do that?" I was a 16-year-old, 17-year-old boy.  I didn't know what to do.

        MEHTA 3: Dr. Srivatsan’s older brother, who still lives in Ranipet in the house in which they grew up, serves as a liaison for UCLA’s RISHI chapter and spoke about Dr. Srivatsan’s commitment to the village.

        VASUDEVAN 1: He wants to spend everything to the poor. He didn’t have anything (back then). He wore a dhoti (traditional Indian garment) just like this one.

        MEHTA 4: After completing his doctoral degree in biochemistry in the city of Bangalore, Dr. Srivatsan aimed to leave the country for the U.S., which brought him to UCLA for his postgraduate studies in 1977. Eventually, after working with several other universities, Srivatsan returned for a position as a medical professor of surgery at UCLA in 1995.

        SRIVATSAN 3: One of these days I'll have to write a biography. I was the first one to come out of Ranipet outside, here. First to go to Chennai. First to go to Bangalore. And then of course, abroad.

        MEHTA 5: While abroad, Srivatsan maintained a strong tie with his family and his home, returning for visits when possible and giving back what he could to his home village of Vadamanappakkam. Then, in 2005, four students working under Dr. Srivatsan at the time – Grant Lee, Ravi Menghani, Aswin Sekar and Daniel Choi – showed interest in starting a nonprofit doing work in rural India. They collaborated with Srivatsan to begin Project RISHI, and Srivatsan provided the necessary ties that the students needed with the village to work with them directly.

        SRIVATSAN 4: When Grant and Ravi said “Where do we start?,” I said I don't know what to do. But I knew the village needs it. Now we've come a long way, from 2005 to 2015. The restrooms in the village, there’s a playground, there (are) restrooms for women, a clinic, every three days a week, senior physician comes around, medication comes from Chennai free of cost to villagers.

        MEHTA 6: Project RISHI continues to implement new projects, and as mentioned earlier, the hand-washing demonstration was one of them this year. But in order to come to the conclusion that a demo would be needed, RISHI learned from past attempts to address hygiene. Co-President Suruchi Salgar was unable to make this year's trip due to unforeseen circumstances, but visited the village last year with her peers.

        SALGAR 1: There was one issue with one of our projects, we realized, with the soap project. What happened was, we were giving kids soap in schools because a lot of people couldn’t afford it, and then we found out that a lot of kids were like selling the soap and buying candy with their money, which is like, adorable but also kind of problematic at the same time. And it never came out, you know, in all the talks with the teachers and the principals over the phone, but sort of once you’re there, you realize things like this happen...

        MEHTA 7: Salgar brings up an issue that nonprofit work often raises. In trying to introduce new resources to a community with age-old traditions, external organizations do not only face resistance to change, but also innocent incidents – such as the one Salgar described – actually become problematic in the long run. Professor Robert Spich, spoke to me over Skype about the difficulty surrounding the introduction of ideas like hand-washing in a rural village.

        SPICH 1: Can you imagine if they sold us cell phones and they never told us how they work? Obviously products need to be explained. And of course, parents are very concerned about health of their children around the world. There is no country in the world, really, where parents don’t care about the health of their kids. So if you understand who has a stake in the use of a soap that you sell, or an idea that you teach, you educate around the importance of this issue. You know, you really have to have a bigger picture to attribute better use to larger things. If your children are less sick for example, less sickness means you get to go to school and get a free meal, or you get a free book or something else you want. You show them that it’s related to a larger set of outcomes both that they value, and the society values.

        MEHTA 8: Though RISHI had to stop distributing soaps, they attempted a new approach to the same problem. Instead of distributing more soaps, the first set of UCLA students who visited the village performed an educational skit based on hand-washing to raise awareness about the diseases that can result from lack of hygiene.

        REDDY 1: We want to do something that is maintained and self-sufficient. Next year, we want to do more education programs about hygiene and cleanliness...

        MEHTA 9: Archana Reddy, co-president of Project RISHI, and her fellow members found that education is a major component of sustainable development. While education in the context of introducing change to a community, such as with the introduction of soaps, is vital in implementing long-lasting change, access to education is another focus of this group.

        REDDY 2:  I think a big focus right now would just be the educational aspect because a lot of the students right now, it’s gonna be very cyclical if like, they’re not like getting the ability to, like if they’re still in the same system, and still going to the same school, and they don’t end up working, there’s no contribution to the village...

        MEHTA 10: While education in the village has improved, it is still a serious underlying issue that prevents young students from pursuing a college degree and getting a well-paying job. This is a major focus of RISHI’s efforts, as we will see later.

        In the next episode, we look at one of Project RISHI’s current initiatives and how its follow-up work played out during its visit to Vadamanappakkam this summer.

      description: >

        Three years ago, Uday Gulati, who is now the president of RISHI's national team, created the standardized methodology that all chapters of RISHI now follow in the creation and implementation of their projects.


        The first of UCLA’s projects to follow this methodology has been the introduction of alternative cookstoves that do not emit harmful fumes. The traditional mud stoves used in this region had been emitting fumes that were linked to lung infections and cataracts. One of the major focuses of this trip was to collect surveys from those who had purchased the subsidized cookstoves from RISHI over the last three years.


        We followed its survey collection process and find out how the villagers felt the cookstoves had impacted them.

The alternative cookstoves (right) emit fewer harmful fumes than the traditional mud stoves (left). The surveys are the final step of the methodology and involved asking questions about the benefits of the stove, how buyers found out about them, and their general sentiments about having purchased them.

          caption: This is the methodology that was created by current president of the National Team of Project RISHI, Uday Gulati, in 2013. The entire organization follows this methodology for the implementation of its projects. During its trip this year, the UCLA chapter initiated follow-up surveys to its cookstove project. The cookstove project is the first of UCLA’s projects to have reached the final stage of the methodology.

She is the state-appointed coordinator for the women’s Self Help Groups, or SHGs, in the entire Tiruvannamalai district, including the ones in Vadamanappakkam. She is also one of the economically better-off members of the village, as is apparent from the relatively large size of her home and the resources she has access to, such as more sophisticated furniture and a TV.

          caption: This is one of the four industrial-sized cookstoves provided by Project RISHI to the two schools in Vadamanappakkam. It reduces indoor pollution by about 90 percent, according to Prakti Design, which made the cookstoves. Out of the four stoves, only one was in use during the lunch period at both schools. When asked why, the school cooks explained that there was more space outside to cook on the mud stove, and that it was also faster for cooking large quantities of food.

          caption: Traditional pots and pans can be seen inside the homes of the village cooks, who provide food for certain members of the village every day. They have purchased one of the subsidized cookstoves, but explained that it is primarily used for simple tasks like boiling water or milk. The Greenway cookstove, they explained, is too small for their pots, pans and for cooking for a large number of people.

          caption: These are some of the homes in the area where many of the cookstove surveys were collected. The majority of houses with cookstoves were located in a part of the village that is marked by relative affluence. This is likely because those in relatively affluent areas are more likely to be able to afford a cookstove priced at 500 rupees. The income of a day laborer or weaver, which are some of the most common professions in the village, is about 2,000 rupees a month.

          caption: In the home of the village cooks who provide food for certain members of the village every day, a gas stove is used for most of their cooking, though they also have a cookstove. They explained that the gas stove is practical as it can support multiple pots at one time and is convenient for quick use. The traditional mud stove and the Greenway cookstove both require wood as fuel, which how food was cooked by everyone in Vadamanappakkam before gas and electric connections became more accessible. The scheduled caste areas still use mud stoves.

      transcript: >

        GULATI 1: As college students, we are limited in our ability to make a difference because we are still gaining these technical skills. We don’t have the same resources that full-time doctors and engineers do.

        MEHTA 1: This is Uday Gulati, one of the earliest members of Project RISHI, or Rural India Social and Health Improvement, and former president of the UC Berkeley chapter.

        GULATI 2: So as college students, what we can do is serve as an intermediate between people developing these solutions for the bottom of the pyramid, full-time, and connecting those innovative solutions, affordable solutions, saleable solutions  to the villagers who actually benefit from them.

        MEHTA 2: Gulati is now the president of RISHI’s National Team, and was also responsible for designing RISHI’s methodology back in 2013. The methodology involves observation, solutions and implementation. Since then, all chapters have followed this unified model for their projects. For the UCLA chapter’s first project using this methodology, they decided to address the villagers’ use of mud stoves, which emit smoke and can cause health issues such as lung infections and cataracts.

        GULATI 3: The first part is that the villagers we are trying to help actually want to address that problem. Next, using the data we collect,  we use that data to prove there is a problem. For example, we find that the inhalation of smoke is a problem – the next step is to look at solutions that already exist, like already existing solutions that have been proven to address that problem before. So for example, if villagers decided that inhalation from smoke is a problem, then the next step is to look at solutions to address that problem.

        MEHTA 3: RISHI decided to partner with cookstove producer and social enterprise Greenway Appliances to sell clean-burning alternative cookstoves to the villagers at a subsidized price.

        GULATI 4: They’ve proven their cookstoves are making a positive difference in similar areas with similar problems. Now we can maximize the chance that using these cookstoves in the village, that’s a positive difference that we’ll make. Last step is to measure are the villager decreasing the money they spent on cookstoves, and did we reduce diseases caused by smoke inhalation? That’s the stage this project is at right now.

        MEHTA 4: Project RISHI was able to market and sell 88 stoves to villagers over the last two years. During this trip to the village of Manappakkam, the members who visited made collecting follow-up surveys regarding the performance of the cookstoves their primary goal. We followed RISHI members as they collected responses from people in the village. Our translator, Ravi Chandran, interpreted for us the words of various women in the village who had bought and used the stoves.

        She has a gas stove with two burners, she has a gas cookstove, and she has the old oven made of mud. Not used these days she cooks most of her stuff on the gas stove and during monsoon season she uses the cookstove for heating water or something.

        MEHTA: At another home, one of the buyers of the cookstoves said the following.

        She bought three stoves. And all of them have gone to her daughter. She’s not using one.

        MEHTA: Later that day, this was another survey that was collected.

        She was told by __ that it used less firewood and it would be good to use. But she bought it, and she has kept it in the loft and she’d probably be using it on some rainy day.

        MEHTA 5: Some of the villagers noted that the stove could be faster than their old mud stoves, that they generally like it, and when asked if they would recommend it to a friend, some said they would.  However there were also other assessments of the stove. From the majority of surveys they were able to collect, third-year Spanish and economics student and Financial Director of UCLA RISHI, Akash Raman explained his impressions.

        RAMAN 1: The biggest complaint was the price, and then the size. The cookstove in its current form is rather tall and small, and you can’t put big pans and pots on it, and you can’t cook a large amount of food on it, which is often what happens. So the two biggest complaints were the price and the size.  But what worked is that there is less smoke being emitted compared to the traditional mudstove.

        MEHTA 6: These cookstoves were proven to be effective in other villages based on research conducted by Greenway Appliances. Every community has very specific ways of doing things, so changing a behavior is especially challenging, as Professor Spich mentions.

        SPICH 1: To try to get people to try a new kind of stove, that’s hard to change. Because they have experimented and seen the way it works. Does it change the taste of the food? How does it affect the texture? These products are not wonderful just because they’re introducing new modern technology. Their success has so much to do with how they fit into people’s present lives.

        MEHTA 7: As we walked through some of the relatively affluent homes in the village to collect surveys, Latha Aunty, who serves as a guide and one of the primary liaisons between the students and the villagers, described what she had observed since the beginning of the project.

        LATHA 1: It’s only the people who can afford it who are buying these stoves; they’re not being bought by the poorest section. There are people here who don't have legs or have one leg, and are still using that leg to stitch and weave. It’s people like them who need to be helped by the Project.

        MEHTA 8: Though RISHI’s intention is to alleviate the health problems caused by traditional cookstoves, several villagers who can actually afford the stoves already had either a gas or electric stove that did not pose a danger to their health. So the question arises, what compelled these villagers to buy the alternative cook stove? Mrs. K. Shakuntala, one of the buyers of the stove, gave an answer similar to others who were surveyed.

        SHAKUNTALA 1: I bought it because Purushothaman said it would be good for me, better than the traditional stoves. So I took his word for it.

        VEMBUSUBRAMANIAN 1: They didn’t really explain why they bought the cookstoves. What they said was that everyone was buying it, so they were like “Cool, I’ll get one too.” A lot of the people were using another stove, like the gas stove, for their primary stuff. They needed another stove to do secondary things like heating water for baths; that’s what they use the cookstoves for.

        MEHTA 9: That was second-year mathematics/economics student Mohini Vembusubramanian, who went on the first part of this year’s trip. Another problem, as mentioned by Raman earlier, was pricing. Due to a miscommunication, villagers were told the stove would cost them 200 rupees, with 1,000 rupees being subsidized by RISHI, as the total cost of the stove is 1,200 rupees. When the stoves were distributed, they were told by Latha and Purushothaman that the cost to them would actually be 500 rupees, leading some villagers to suspect that Latha and Purushothaman could be taking a cut. Mrs. Shakuntala experienced this, too.

        SHAKUNTALA 2: Later on when we were told it was 500 rupees, we thought we were getting cheated.

        MEHTA 10: Both reporter P. Sainath and Professor Spich have encountered such mixed messages and the effects they can produce in a small community.

        SPICH 2: You’re gonna be angry. Can forgive people for making a mistake, they had no idea what the real price was… You gotta be careful ever, to mention a number. Whenever you change a number, in this case price, you’re gonna get people, there’s a whole series of emotional reactions you’re gonna get.  Once that happens, and trust is broken? Man, then it doesn’t come back.

        SAINATH 1: It’s very common that well-meaning NPO’s (nonprofit organizations) and NGO’s (non governmental organizations) come and create confusion with the best of intentions, unable to address the issues. They’re coming out of their middle-class skins, and they’re unable to step out of their middle-class universe.

        VEMBUSUBRAMANIAN 2: We talked about lowering the price and figuring out ways to do that, but the problems we faced were, one, the people who already bought it for 500 were gonna revolt; they’d be absolutely infuriated if they found out their neighbor got it for like, 200, and they paid 500 for it. Just that discrepancy – people talk about everything here, so that may not be taken to kindly. But we definitely do need to come up with more creative solutions to make people afford it.

        MEHTA 11: As Vembusubramanian said, everything is talked about in a village as small and tightly knit as this one. The cookstove project is just one of many instances that is demonstrative of the kinds of roadblocks that outside agents face when entering such communities. Though the sensitivity of each situation is difficult to predict, such complexities have risen in countless communities in which an external organization is present.

        In our next and final episode, we discuss some of the concerns the villagers themselves express as well as the ways in which RISHI has impacted their community.

      description: >

        Nonprofit organizations must take many factors into consideration before entering a village such as Vadamanappakkam. Project RISHI’s presence, according to the villagers we hear from in this episode, has brought positive influence to the village.

        However, RISHI has also overlooked certain intricacies of village life and may reinforce pre-existing divisions that contribute to stark disparities between sectors of the village.

        Residents of the village and experts share opinions on RISHI's work in Vadamanappakkam.

        SAINATH 1: And the trouble is they look at these things as projects.They do not see a  process. Not because of their intentions but because of how that plays out in the real world. How does it interface with what’s out there?

        MEHTA 1: As reporter and rural affairs expert Palagummi Sainath suggests, there is no simple formula or solution to reducing poverty and its manifestations in villages such as Vadamanappakkam, even with the best of intentions. Most governments aim to alleviate poverty, after all, and civilizations have always struggled with the complexities of doing so. Even large-scale organizations risk disrupting communities they had set out to aid. Professor Robert Spich shared his expertise on this recurring and especially difficult problem.

        SPICH 1: Let’s say a group wants to give kids a certain kind of medicine, and it’s worked very well, let’s say in the outside world. And the thoughts are very simple causality. Give them medicine, get rid of the disease, everything will be happy in the village. But they realize increasingly these issues are much more complex and they involve these five different or six different areas in development. You have to think about, say if you bring this medicine in, how does it impact political issues, or economic issues about whether they can afford this. There’s cultural issues, there’s technology issues, all those sorts of things come into play. It takes quite a while to be able to understand the workings of a village. What you really want to do, it takes time and it takes intimate knowledge like (the knowledge of) language. Understanding what  really going on takes time, and non-profit organizations often don’t have it.

        MEHTA 2:  Within such organizations, different chapters and sectors have slightly or sometimes majorly different ways of doing things. Even within a relatively smaller-scale organization like Rural India Social and Health Improvement, the chapters have different ways of operating. While UCLA trips tend to last about a week, UC Berkeley’s chapter, for example, visits its village with groups averaging 15 people and for three weeks at a time. Members must also take a special course on international development, social entrepreneurship and other such related topics in order to join RISHI’s chapter at Berkeley. Such structural differences, even with a consistent methodology, account for disparities within the organization’s chapters. But its presence alone can affect a community. Latha Krishnan, who has served as one of RISHI’s liaisons from the beginning in Vadamanappakkam, notes such impact.

        LATHA 1: The children here in the village were good students even before RISHI came into the village, however after RISHIs members started visiting more, they have interacted with the village students. And these interactions have proven to be an inspiration to the village students. They feel that they should also be like them, they should also progress in their studies, they should also be able to go out of the village to earn their livelihood, and that they can also be settling abroad.

        MEHTA 3: However, the purpose of the presence of these organizations is often misconstrued and misunderstood.

        LATHA 2: Vasudevan, Dr. Srivatsan’s brother, informed me they would be coming, but why they would be coming and what is the reason of their visit was not made clear to me. People have told me that they would be making further developments and improvements, such as building the inpatient facility on the first floor or giving saline drips and IV fluids in the adjacent room to the examination room. While this will probably happen eventually, I would like to see educated people, qualified people, even people from the Project living here, or coming on a very regular basis here, so that they can attend to emergencies and patients. For example if a dehydrated person comes, it’s not totally necessary for the doctor to be present. Even a qualified nurse can do an IV injection. So I would prefer someone qualified would come on a regular basis to the village.

        MEHTA 4: This matter of time is a problem for many nonprofits. Even though locals run the clinic, the level of education is not sufficient to deal with medical problems when a doctor is not present. And the doctor that RISHI employs at the clinic is present at most six hours a week. There is no educated authority who knows the inner workings of both RISHI and the village to oversee matters on a daily basis.

        LATHA 3: After these people have come and gone, the youth and others in the village, they keep asking me, who are these people, why have they come, what have they done for the village? And I have to answer  to them.

        SPICH 2: The underlying work of a non profit, more so than a for-profit organization, is essentially to work themselves out of a job. A mataphor is, it’s a little bit like taking wild animals and getting them accustomed to nature again. We realize that at some point we need to reintroduce it to nature so it can sustain life on its own. It will no longer have those critical dependencies on us. But the fundamental idea should be a part of what a nonprofit thinks also. It’s what happens when we create something that doesn’t need us anymore.

        MEHTA 5: When asked what she sees as the most pressing need for this village among all the things RISHI is attempting to improve, Krishnan expressed that the scheduled castes within the village require the most attention.

        LATHA 4: Even though water is a small problem, we still get water, and we are managing. What is direly required is employment opportunities, especially for the women. Something also needs to be done for the poorest section of the village. THIS is the primary need, or the very basic need. I have already communicated this to Project RISHI.

        MEHTA 6: Demands are plentiful once an outside agent comes into a community such as Manappakkam, but it is hard for members of the village to understand the time it takes for these changes to come. Communication between the two parties is difficult. One member of the village, who requested to remain anonymous, said the following. We have a neutral party who is speaking in place of the source.

        ANONYMOUS 1: There have been a lot of promises made, a lot of carrots shown. And they have not borne fruit. For example, there was a move sometime back to set up a drinking-water plant here. Even some of the government officials were brought by the Project RISHI people, and they inspected the area and did a survey but nothing came out of it. Then they said that they would begin computer classes and donating computers, but that too didn’t take shape. So we are confused about why these people come here, what they are doing here and what will actually come of their visits.

        MEHTA 7: When I asked Dr. Srivatsan about the talk of potential plans for introducing a water purification system, he did have an explanation for why things didn’t go through.

        SRIVATSAN 1:  Water ... there is a shortage. This village of course, is more of a dry village. Not a lot of water, not a lot of rain. Now if we install it, this reverse osmosis, 50 percent of it will be wasted. So we dont have, first of all, water, and then if we have to waste village water, it’s not our water, it’s village water. You’re talking 20,000 liters a day. Nobody will get water afterwards. That’s the problem.

        MEHTA 8: Sorting out the logistics of something as major as introducing a reverse osmosis plan, which would cost nearly $30,000 if it were suitable, understandably took a great deal of time. But the villagers were confused as to why nothing came of the initial inspection to place the reverse osmosis tank. A way to solve miscommunications and gaps in the intricate cultural knowledge required to know the inner workings of a village is finding a liaison who can communicate to both parties coherently and accurately, but also one who knows his or her people and their struggles intimately, someone who lives in the village but knows the outside world too. This is S. Murali, or Murali as he is called, a 29 year old native of Manapakkam.

        MURALI 1: When we go to the companies, I can’t introduce myself. Whatever they are asking, the manager, in the interviews, I can’t answer clearly. That is a basic problem.  I felt, this is very bad. After we discussed something, thought we need to change the school itself. So we have taken the help of the teachers, and now we are taking the help of Project RISHI.

        MEHTA 9: Murali was born and raised in this village, but is one of few local youths who left for a higher education and job prospects. He is one of the only members of the village who can converse in English. He feels that educating the youth of the village, especially in conversational English, is the path to getting job opportunities and a brighter future for these children. G. Senthilvelan is a friend of Murali’s and a volunteer in Chennai for a nonprofit called Smile Foundation.

        SENTHIVELAN 1: So in our village, most of the parents are not interested in their sons’ or daughters’ education. The students only study by themselves. The parents are not able to help because they don't haven’t knowledge about education. So we need to change that mindset.

        MEHTA 10: Smile Foundation educates underprivileged children and women with what it calls “relevant education,” or education that is relevant to its beneficiaries’ skill set, economic status and geographic location. Conversational English is one such program.

        SENTHIVELAN 2: Even though we settled into some companies, we are (still) struggling in spoken English. Because even though we speak something … we are unable to. If we speak to some clients, they are unable to grasp. So that’s why we want to teach our students in early stages only, so that after that they have some interest in English. After that itself they are able to learn. So that’s our motive.

        MEHTA 11: Senthilvelan, Murali and three of their other friends from Manappakkam plan to start a Smile Foundation study center in partnership with Project RISHI. RISHI member Akash Raman was primarily responsible for an English learning program this year for the school children, and during this trip, talked about future possibilities with Murali, Senthivelan, and the others.

        RAMAN 1: They are very similar to us in the sense that they want to improve the village in as many ways as possible. Murali suggested that we could partner with Smile Foundation. He said if we partnered with them, we could start our own program and run it for three (to) six months and then show the Smile Foundation that it works, and they would pick it up and run it exclusively on volunteers.

        MEHTA 12: If RISHI’s curriculum and paid teacher shows success over the three-to-six-month testing period, Smile Foundation will take over free of cost. This is a potentially sustainable project that RISHI is considering implementing in the village.

        SENTHILVELAN 3: In Smile Foundation why we are servicing, even though we are facing a lot of struggles … because of our work we feel some smiles from our students. That’s the thing we want. Even though we have some personal drawbacks or difficulties, that moment will clear everything.

        MEHTA 13: I asked these five men why they wanted to continue living in the village even though their jobs were far away and in a city with better prospects.

        SENTHILVELAN 4: The first thing is our parents. Even though we have been able to mingle with the Chennai environment, our parents are not able to mingle with the Chennai environment … because they are (of an) older mindset. Their mindset is always living in native place only, that’s one thing. And second thing is with our knowledge, we have settled some level of life in Chennai, so we need some more people from our village to settle like this. For that purpose we need not only English, we need to gain more knowledge to our students … knowledge and job. And the third one is, not only student’s life, we need to improve our general village people life.

        MURALI 2: We can’t live without service for this village. Our parents, they struggled to study for ourselves. This is not easy. My brother also (did) not study also because (he had to earn) ... money. My parents’ salary is very low. We are getting the money, but ... if we don’t give this opportunity to these students, this village is getting low. We can’t live like this. At least we need to help them.

        MEHTA 14: While outside agents like nonprofits have hurdles of their own to overcome, a grassroots movement like the one Murali and his friends are undertaking by partnering with a non profit could be the combination of inside knowledge and outside resources necessary to make progress.

        SPICH 3: A solution is never permanent. Solutions should not be looked at as perfect phenomena , but probably as continuous phenomena. Whatever a (nonprofit organization) is introducing in terms of a solution, it’s never permanent, it’s never “We have a solution that will last forever.” It’s not.

        MEHTA 15: The aim of Project RISHI as well as many up-and-coming nonprofits is to bring sustainable development to a village like Vadamanappakkam, which means those who actually live in the village would eventually be empowered to support themselves without the help of any outside agents. Spich discussed the idea of organizations working “themselves out of a job” being the goal of sustainability, and RISHI too has mentioned that this is its ultimate goal. Though some organizations have been successful at achieving this, every community has its unique needs and there is no singular, simple formula. As the old proverb says, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."

    ## Acknowledgements

    This multimedia series is the eighth to be funded and supported by the Bridget O’Brien Scholarship Foundation. The aim of the scholarship is to give UCLA student journalists unique exposure by allowing them the opportunity to cover global stories.

    As O’Brien herself said, “The more of the world I see, the better I am as a journalist. ... And the more I work as a journalist, the more analytically I view the world as I travel.”

    O’Brien was a UCLA student and a zealous photojournalist for the Daily Bruin with a great passion for covering stories around the world. Her passion went so far as to give up the comfort of an apartment to sometimes live out of her car in her final year at UCLA so that she could save up for travel. O’Brien’s final story in the Daily Bruin was uncovering the fair-trade coffee movement in Nicaragua. Three years after this story was published in both the Daily Bruin and USA Today, O’Brien passed away in a car accident.

    O’Brien’s tenacity and dedication to both journalism and travel inspired her parents and loved ones to start the Bridget O’Brien Scholarship Foundation the year after her death. They wanted to pass on the enriching opportunity of pursuing international journalism to other students at UCLA.

    We are truly honored to have received such an esteemed opportunity and would like to express our deepest gratitude to O’Brien’s parents, Mari and Kevin O’Brien as well as her loyal troop of friends and loved ones who make up the foundation. We hope we did this honor  justice.

    Working with those at the Daily Bruin has been the most incredible team effort we have ever had experience with. All the people in the office who were approached with one of the many questions and suggestions we asked for, invested their time and energies into this project as if it were their own. So really, Give a Man a Fish belongs to everyone who had a hand in producing it. Some of the specific individuals  we would like to acknowledge are below:
