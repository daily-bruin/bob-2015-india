    Ten years ago, Project RISHI, Rural India Social and Health Improvement, was founded at UCLA by Dr. Eri Srivatsan and four of the students working under him. Today, it is a 10-chapter, national nonprofit organization that implements projects aiming to promote sustainable development in rural India. This series is a survey of the work that six members of the UCLA chapter of Project RISHI completed between Sept. 9 through Sept. 17 in a village called Vadamanappakkam, located in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.


    Radio reporter Jonaki Mehta, photographer Sonja Bartlett and an external translator, Ravindranath Chandran, spent nine days in Vadamanappakkam covering the progress and effectiveness of Project RISHI’s initiatives and exploring the complexities of this rural village and its residents.


    This project was made possible by the [Bridget O’Brien Scholarship Foundation](http://rememberingbridget.com/), which has funded UCLA’s student journalists for eight years to cover stories of a global reach and local impact.

      description: >

        In the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu lies a village called Vadamanappakkam, or Manappakkam for short. Tamil Nadu is known for its welfare programs, aimed at the most economically disadvantaged communities in the state.


        A society that relies primarily on agricultural farming and weaving, Manappakkam is a small village with complex socioeconomic dynamics, yet is also closely knit.


        Wanting to give back to his ancestral village,  Srivatsan began Project RISHI with four other students in hopes of introducing sustainable development to Manappakkam, and in turn, other villages in India. The ways in which the state government segments its demographics and the populations that require welfare programs is through the caste system, an ancient system of social classification. In this village, as in many other rural villages of India, the geographic distribution of its population is determined by caste, and thus economic status and profession.


        This episode expands further on how this system has residual effects in this community, and how that interfaces with nonprofit work.  While government aid to low-income communities is vital, nonprofit work comes into play where government aid cannot.

        EPISODE 1: Casting a Line

        MEHTA 1: This is Vadamanappakkam, a rural village tucked away in the Tiruvannamalai district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, where the heat is sweltering nearly year round and the cows graze in slowly withering grasses with cawing crows on their backs. [AMBI of birds/rooster/cows] The near-5,000 residents of Vadamanappakkam – or Manappakkam, for short – have risen well before the sun to begin their day. Some head to one of the village’s many Hindu temples for their daily worship, while others prepare for the day’s work.

        It’s here that Project RISHI, a student organization founded at UCLA, first began to work toward its aim of sustainable development in rural India. RISHI stands for Rural India Social and Health Improvement. The student-run nonprofit has created concrete change in Manappakkam through various projects, but the lack of continuity in its presence and factors that are a result of RISHI being an outside agent based abroad also pose constraints. For instance, the group had aimed to collect 88 follow-up surveys in accordance with its methodology, but they were only able to complete 25 with the given time. The group has also come head-to-head with complex cultural issues such as the residual effects of the caste system in India, which is an ancient system of social classification. While some progress has been made due to its presence, other complexities are often overlooked.

        For example, the scheduled caste areas as they are labeled by the state government are composed of the most poverty-stricken communities in the village. They are geographically separated from the central town where the businesses, clinic and restrooms are located. And many of the tacit boundaries that stand between higher castes like Brahmins and the most backward caste, or MBC, are a hurdle of their own kind. I asked one of the members of the scheduled caste whether or not she has attempted to express her needs to Project RISHI or any authorities. Mrs. Munuswamy, age 66, responded with the following.

        MUNUSWAMY 1: Whenever we go there to talk to Dr. Srivatsan (Dr. Eri S. Srivatsan) or his family, there are already a lot of other people surrounding them, so we cannot approach them. It's a question of the highest caste, Brahmin. How can someone like me from a lower caste approach him directly? It’s a mental block.

        MEHTA 2: A number of the projects that the group has put forth have stood in the village for years, but sustainability has been difficult to attain. The group attends to the needs of the village as the society changes, which is an issue that Professor Robert Spich, senior lecturer of global economics and management at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, has encountered.

        SPICH 1:  I think underestimating the complexity of the issues is a problem nonprofits organizations tend to have. Another related issue is that these societies – well all societies, are changing. These societies are not static, people might say, “Oh, villages are static, nothing changes.” That’s just not true today.

        MEHTA 3: RISHI’s goals do involve addressing that the village is changing. A part of its methodology involves finding out the particular desires of each village it works with.

        PURUSHOTHAMAN 1: Dr. Srivatsan used to visit the village on and off, fairly often. And during his visits, he was told by the villagers that there was a dire need for a hospital here because there is nothing close-by. And heeding to their requests, this dispensary was built.

        MEHTA 4: D. Purushothaman is a local man who is paid by Project RISHI to manage the clinic that they  built in 2008 after the village residents expressed the need for local medical care. Many of the villagers use the clinic as a meeting point, or accompany their elders at times when they feel an ache from bending over in the fields or a persisting cough, for example. While the doctor is only assigned to come, at most, three times a week for two hours each day, the local population of the village relies on the clinic on most days of the week for access to medication.The clinic also serves as a site for occasional medical camps such as eye camps or dental camps that Project RISHI arranges through private hospitals that provide pro bono work in underserved communities

        Project RISHI, however, is not limited to this village and its projects. RISHI now has 10 total chapters throughout 10 universities in the U.S. with an aim for using methods of sustainable development through projects to provide necessities like restrooms, clean water and access to education. Each chapter works in a different village in India with its own specific needs. Manappakkam continues to be the village the UCLA chapter works with. The village’s local government, which is called a panchayat, is led by a 44-year-old president, P. Thulasiraman, who spoke to us about the village’s demographics.

        THULASIRAMAN 1: The number of working people in the village are 2,500, and the total population is around 5,000.

        MEHTA 5: Agricultural farming and weaving are the main professions here, but as weaving becomes more advanced on an industrial level and monsoon seasons run dryer and dryer, the prospects for both professions are dwindling.

        THULASIRAMAN 2: The four communities living here are Yadavas, Mudaliars, Vanniyars, and Sengunthars.

        MEHTA 6: These four communities make up the “backwards class,” or BC, and MBC within the caste system that make up the population of the village. Manappakkam was once a village whose citizens were geographically divided by the caste to which they belonged, with streets named after the caste who belonged there. Today the divisions are less stark but still present.

        THULASIRAMAN 3: And then the SCs, meaning the “scheduled castes.” Scheduled castes and “scheduled tribes” are people who have been deprived of facilities that other castes enjoy. They are the economically and socially backward and downtrodden communities.

        MEHTA 7: The caste system is an extremely complex hierarchical system that is slowly fading in India at large, but its residual effects and resulting social norms still exist in most rural areas. The “backwards class,” or the BC, and the “most backwards class” or MBC, were historically segregated and granted far fewer resources and facilities relative to the higher castes that fall into the “other castes” sector of the caste system. The most marginalized communities within the caste system are the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, which make up nearly 17 percent and 9 percent respectively of India’s population. We noticed that the local high school kept records of the  students by caste.

        THULASIRAMAN 4: These demarcations on the board for the castes that you saw in the school have been required by the government because the government of Tamil Nadu bases its grants to the school and the provision of other facilities on the basis of the caste difference. This is because of the large economic disparity between the castes.

        MEHTA 8: Mrs. Munuswamy, who spoke earlier about difficulties breaching the informal caste boundaries, also mentioned other hurdles that she and her family face that are indirectly related to caste.

        MUNUSWAMY 2: The restrooms built by RISHI are also too far away for us to reach and water access is a problem because of how far away we live from tanks in the village. We also want our grandson to attend kindergarten, but we can’t afford school uniforms, so he will just have to wait to go to the government-run elementary school when he turns 5. It’s too expensive.

        MEHTA 9: However, Latha Krishnan, who is a village resident and serves as a primary liaison for the students while they visit, explains that the youth of the village is changing such dynamics slowly.

        KRISHNAN 1: The youth of the village, they gather together to help a person in distress. If there is a need, such as an emergency, or somebody’s sister is getting married, or there is a sudden requirement for money, they will pool together whatever they have and come forward to help the person.

        MEHTA 10: And though the MBC and BC groups as well as the village at large lack access to resources and education, there are several welfare schemes in place to uplift the lower castes out of poverty. These include providing bicycles for students beginning in the 11th grade, one free meal for students provided in school, or the famous “Amma canteen” program introduced by Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram, or “Amma,” as she is called, which means “mother.” Palagummi Sainath, former rural affairs editor of The Hindu, a major national newspaper in India, spoke to me about Tamil Nadu’s welfare programs.

        SAINATH 1: Look at, say, for instance bicycles is one, the Amma canteen is an incredible...that was a brain wave. I mean, I think that’s been a huge draw. It shows you how much residual hunger there is in the Indian population. Tamil Nadu is one of the better-off states when it comes to education, and educational levels and quality. So that should give you an idea of what’s happening in the rest of the country. The level of welfarism in these states, the level of demands and expectations of the public are much higher than you would find in, say, Bihar or U.P. (Uttar Pradesh).

        MEHTA 11: While government programs have an impact on the reduction of poverty in Tamil Nadu, their efforts are generalized to the struggles faced by the lower castes in the entire state. What governments cannot do is listen to the specific, most pressing needs of the people directly. This is a gap that leaves room for nongovernment organizations and nonprofit organizations to step in and take a more personalized approach to the specific demands of each community.

        VEMBUSUBRAMANIAN 2: If you were to compare, like, Project RISHI’s work to something bigger like Red Cross or something like that, Red Cross is focused more on just helping the macro environment in the country, help everyone get out of poverty or whatever. But that can sometimes ignore, like, the actual desires of the people. I think working with a small village and each chapter working with a small village helps, kind of more focus on the actual needs of the people.

        MEHTA 12: That was Mohini Vembusubramanian, one of the six members of Project RISHI’s UCLA Chapter who visited Vadamanappakkam this summer. They visited this year to follow up on one of their past projects and to make new observations for future ones.

        In the next episode, we explore the difficulties RISHI has faced in past projects and their efforts towards a new approach.
