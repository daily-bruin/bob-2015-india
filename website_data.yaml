    ## Editor's Note

    Ten years ago, Project RISHI, Rural India Social and Health Improvement, was founded at UCLA by Dr. Eri Srivatsan and four of the students working under him. Today, it is a 10-chapter, national nonprofit organization that implements projects aiming to promote sustainable development in rural India. This series is a survey of the work that six members of the UCLA chapter of Project RISHI completed between Sept. 9 through Sept. 17 in a village called Vadamanappakkam, located in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.


    Radio reporter Jonaki Mehta, photographer Sonja Bartlett and an external translator, Ravindranath Chandran, spent nine days in Vadamanappakkam covering the progress and effectiveness of Project RISHI’s initiatives and exploring the complexities of this rural village and its residents.


    This project was made possible by the [Bridget O’Brien Scholarship Foundation](http://rememberingbridget.com/), which has funded UCLA’s student journalists for eight years to cover stories of a global reach and local impact.

    - title: CASTING A LINE
      description: >

        In the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu lies a village called Vadamanappakkam, or Manappakkam for short. Tamil Nadu is known for its welfare programs, aimed at the most economically disadvantaged communities in the state.


        A society that relies primarily on agricultural farming and weaving, Manappakkam is a small village with complex socioeconomic dynamics, yet is also closely knit.


        Wanting to give back to his ancestral village,  Srivatsan began Project RISHI with four other students in hopes of introducing sustainable development to Manappakkam, and in turn, other villages in India. The ways in which the state government segments its demographics and the populations that require welfare programs is through the caste system, an ancient system of social classification. In this village, as in many other rural villages of India, the geographic distribution of its population is determined by caste, and thus economic status and profession.


        This episode expands further on how this system has residual effects in this community, and how that interfaces with nonprofit work.  While government aid to low-income communities is vital, nonprofit work comes into play where government aid cannot.

          caption: This is a map of Vadamanappakkam. In the past, members of the castes after which the streets are named lived on the streets designated to their caste. Today, there is only one Brahmin left living in the village, who is a relative of Dr. Eri S. Srivatsan, a professor of surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and his family. The castes intermix more, but the Scheduled Caste area, which is in the outer regions of the village, are the lowest economic status of the village’s members. The distance to the projects implemented by Project RISHI in the village, such as restrooms and the clinic, was a complaint that two of the families in the scheduled caste area mentioned.

A paid doctor is assigned by the nonprofit to work at the clinic at most three times a week, for two hours each day. In the nine days that Project RISHI was in the village this summer, he only came to the clinic once.

Over 65 eye surgeries have been performed for residents of Vadamanappakkam since the eye camps began being held here.

        MEHTA 1: This is Vadamanappakkam, a rural village tucked away in the Tiruvannamalai district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, where the heat is sweltering nearly year round and the cows graze in slowly withering grasses with cawing crows on their backs. [AMBI of birds/rooster/cows] The near-5,000 residents of Vadamanappakkam – or Manappakkam, for short – have risen well before the sun to begin their day. Some head to one of the village’s many Hindu temples for their daily worship, while others prepare for the day’s work.

        It’s here that Project RISHI, a student organization founded at UCLA, first began to work toward its aim of sustainable development in rural India. RISHI stands for Rural India Social and Health Improvement. The student-run nonprofit has created concrete change in Manappakkam through various projects, but the lack of continuity in its presence and factors that are a result of RISHI being an outside agent based abroad also pose constraints.* The group has also come head-to-head with complex cultural issues such as the residual effects of the caste system in India, which is an ancient system of social classification. While some progress has been made due to its presence, other complexities are often overlooked.

        For example, the scheduled caste areas as they are labeled by the state government are composed of the most poverty-stricken communities in the village. They are geographically separated from the central town where the businesses, clinic and restrooms are located. And many of the tacit boundaries that stand between higher castes like Brahmins and the most backward caste, or MBC, are a hurdle of their own kind. I asked one of the members of the scheduled caste whether or not she has attempted to express her needs to Project RISHI or any authorities. Mrs. Munuswamy, age 66, responded with the following.

        MUNUSWAMY 1: Whenever we go there to talk to Dr. Srivatsan (Dr. Eri S. Srivatsan) or his family, there are already a lot of other people surrounding them, so we cannot approach them. It's a question of the highest caste, Brahmin. How can someone like me from a lower caste approach him directly? It’s a mental block.

        MEHTA 2: A number of the projects that the group has put forth have stood in the village for years, but sustainability has been difficult to attain. The group attends to the needs of the village as the society changes, which is an issue that Professor Robert Spich, senior lecturer of global economics and management at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, has encountered.

        SPICH 1:  I think underestimating the complexity of the issues is a problem nonprofits organizations tend to have. Another related issue is that these societies – well all societies, are changing. These societies are not static, people might say, “Oh, villages are static, nothing changes.” That’s just not true today.

        MEHTA 3: RISHI’s goals do involve addressing that the village is changing. A part of its methodology involves finding out the particular desires of each village it works with.

        PURUSHOTHAMAN 1: Dr. Srivatsan used to visit the village on and off, fairly often. And during his visits, he was told by the villagers that there was a dire need for a hospital here because there is nothing close-by. And heeding to their requests, this dispensary was built.

        MEHTA 4: D. Purushothaman is a local man who is paid by Project RISHI to manage the clinic that they  built in 2008 after the village residents expressed the need for local medical care. Many of the villagers use the clinic as a meeting point, or accompany their elders at times when they feel an ache from bending over in the fields or a persisting cough, for example. While the doctor is only assigned to come, at most, three times a week for two hours each day, the local population of the village relies on the clinic on most days of the week for access to medication.The clinic also serves as a site for occasional medical camps such as eye camps or dental camps that Project RISHI arranges through private hospitals that provide pro bono work in underserved communities

        Project RISHI, however, is not limited to this village and its projects. RISHI now has 10 total chapters throughout 10 universities in the U.S. with an aim for using methods of sustainable development through projects to provide necessities like restrooms, clean water and access to education. Each chapter works in a different village in India with its own specific needs. Manappakkam continues to be the village the UCLA chapter works with. The village’s local government, which is called a panchayat, is led by a 44-year-old president, P. Thulasiraman, who spoke to us about the village’s demographics.

        THULASIRAMAN 1: The number of working people in the village are 2,500, and the total population is around 5,000.

        MEHTA 5: Agricultural farming and weaving are the main professions here, but as weaving becomes more advanced on an industrial level and monsoon seasons run dryer and dryer, the prospects for both professions are dwindling.

        THULASIRAMAN 2: The four communities living here are Yadavas, Mudaliars, Vanniyars, and Sengunthars.

        MEHTA 6: These four communities make up the “backwards class,” or BC, and MBC within the caste system that make up the population of the village. Manappakkam was once a village whose citizens were geographically divided by the caste to which they belonged, with streets named after the caste who belonged there. Today the divisions are less stark but still present.

        THULASIRAMAN 3: And then the SCs, meaning the “scheduled castes.” Scheduled castes and “scheduled tribes” are people who have been deprived of facilities that other castes enjoy. They are the economically and socially backward and downtrodden communities.

        MEHTA 7: The caste system is an extremely complex hierarchical system that is slowly fading in India at large, but its residual effects and resulting social norms still exist in most rural areas. The “backwards class,” or the BC, and the “most backwards class” or MBC, were historically segregated and granted far fewer resources and facilities relative to the higher castes that fall into the “other castes” sector of the caste system. The most marginalized communities within the caste system are the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, which make up nearly 17 percent and 9 percent respectively of India’s population. We noticed that the local high school kept records of the  students by caste.

        THULASIRAMAN 4: These demarcations on the board for the castes that you saw in the school have been required by the government because the government of Tamil Nadu bases its grants to the school and the provision of other facilities on the basis of the caste difference. This is because of the large economic disparity between the castes.

        MEHTA 8: Mrs. Munuswamy, who spoke earlier about difficulties breaching the informal caste boundaries, also mentioned other hurdles that she and her family face that are indirectly related to caste.

        MUNUSWAMY 2: The restrooms built by RISHI are also too far away for us to reach and water access is a problem because of how far away we live from tanks in the village. We also want our grandson to attend kindergarten, but we can’t afford school uniforms, so he will just have to wait to go to the government-run elementary school when he turns 5. It’s too expensive.

        MEHTA 9: However, Latha Krishnan, who is a village resident and serves as a primary liaison for the students while they visit, explains that the youth of the village is changing such dynamics slowly.

        KRISHNAN 1: The youth of the village, they gather together to help a person in distress. If there is a need, such as an emergency, or somebody’s sister is getting married, or there is a sudden requirement for money, they will pool together whatever they have and come forward to help the person.

        MEHTA 10: And though the MBC and BC groups as well as the village at large lack access to resources and education, there are several welfare schemes in place to uplift the lower castes out of poverty. These include providing bicycles for students beginning in the 11th grade, one free meal for students provided in school, or the famous “Amma canteen” program introduced by Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram, or “Amma,” as she is called, which means “mother.” Palagummi Sainath, former rural affairs editor of The Hindu, a major national newspaper in India, spoke to me about Tamil Nadu’s welfare programs.

        SAINATH 1: Look at, say, for instance bicycles is one, the Amma canteen is an incredible...that was a brain wave. I mean, I think that’s been a huge draw. It shows you how much residual hunger there is in the Indian population. Tamil Nadu is one of the better-off states when it comes to education, and educational levels and quality. So that should give you an idea of what’s happening in the rest of the country. The level of welfarism in these states, the level of demands and expectations of the public are much higher than you would find in, say, Bihar or U.P. (Uttar Pradesh).

        MEHTA 11: While government programs have an impact on the reduction of poverty in Tamil Nadu, their efforts are generalized to the struggles faced by the lower castes in the entire state. What governments cannot do is listen to the specific, most pressing needs of the people directly. This is a gap that leaves room for nongovernment organizations and nonprofit organizations to step in and take a more personalized approach to the specific demands of each community.

        VEMBUSUBRAMANIAN 2: If you were to compare, like, Project RISHI’s work to something bigger like Red Cross or something like that, Red Cross is focused more on just helping the macro environment in the country, help everyone get out of poverty or whatever. But that can sometimes ignore, like, the actual desires of the people. I think working with a small village and each chapter working with a small village helps, kind of more focus on the actual needs of the people.

        MEHTA 12: That was Mohini Vembusubramanian, one of the six members of Project RISHI’s UCLA Chapter who visited Vadamanappakkam this summer. They visited this year to follow up on one of their past projects and to make new observations for future ones.

        In the next episode, we explore the difficulties RISHI has faced in past projects and their efforts towards a new approach.

        (Music by Tony Boardman)
        Corrections: **It was previously stated that the group only completed 25 of 88 surveys they aimed to complete. Project RISHI has informed us that this number may not be accurate as some homes had more than one cookstoves, so the total number of surveys is less than that. The total number of cookstoves sold is 88, not the total number of surveys.

      description: >

        In the first part of their trip, four Project RISHI members performed a skit on handwashing to students at the local high school in order to teach students about the importance of handwashing and hygiene. This demonstration was held in response to the deficiencies of their last project that attempted to address hygiene.


        In addition to exploring past projects, this episode traces Dr. Eri Srivatsan's journey from the outskirts of the village to America, and how his determination for giving back to his ancestral village translated into the UCLA chapter of Project RISHI. We also discuss the evolving needs of the community and how a nonprofit like Project RISHI deals with such changes.

It appeared that while some of the elementary school children use the RISHI-built bathrooms in their school, the high school students only use the government restrooms, or none at all. They also pointed to an outdoor area in the school yard, suggesting that many of the boys especially openly urinate and defecate.

       MEHTA 1: During the first part of their trip, four members of Project RISHI performed a skit to groups of schoolchildren in the village to demonstrate the importance of handwashing. Health and hygiene have been central goals of RISHI’s past projects from the beginning, with the medical clinic being one of the earliest and ongoing projects that addresses health in many aspects. Dr. Eri Srivatsan, whose ancestral home stood where the medical clinic is today, faced many of the challenges that lack of access to basic needs creates when he lived in a town in the outskirts of the village called Ranipet. From his own experiences and the hardships he faced, he felt that he wanted to help his ancestral village in any way he could once he found success in the United States. 

SRIVATSAN 1: I mean I came from a lower-middle class family at that time. I was the fifth child of six, so (we were) living in a small place. Room like this, kitchen and a small bathroom. And so we've come a long way. And most of the time, I had even the dhoti (traditional Hindu male clothing garment). And of course sandals, sometimes. I don't know if I had sandals until sixth or seventh grade – no sandals either. Local high school. So I went to the city, Madras. 12th grade. Everything was in English. It was difficult.

MEHTA 2: Srivatsan was the first to leave Ranipet, where he spent most of his childhood. He went to Madras, or Chennai as it is now called, to work toward a graduate degree.

SRIVATSAN 2: I was one of the first ones to come from Ranipet. First ones, to go there (to Chennai). It was difficult. I went there and I cried. ( The city is) a huge place. But I cried. The day I went there, I thought, "Why did I do that?" I was a 16-year-old, 17-year-old boy.  I didn't know what to do.

MEHTA 3: Dr. Srivatsan’s older brother, who still lives in Ranipet in the house in which they grew up, serves as a liaison for UCLA’s RISHI chapter and spoke about Dr. Srivatsan’s commitment to the village. 

VASUDEVAN 1: He wants to spend everything to the poor. He didn’t have anything (back then). He wore a dhoti (traditional Indian garment) just like this one.

MEHTA 4: After completing his doctoral degree in biochemistry in the city of Bangalore, Dr. Srivatsan aimed to leave the country for the U.S., which brought him to UCLA for his postgraduate studies in 1977. Eventually, after working with several other universities, Srivatsan returned for a position as a medical professor of surgery at UCLA in 1995. 

SRIVATSAN 3: One of these days I'll have to write a biography. I was the first one to come out of Ranipet outside, here. First to go to Chennai. First to go to Bangalore. And then of course, abroad. 

MEHTA 5: While abroad, Srivatsan maintained a strong tie with his family and his home, returning for visits when possible and giving back what he could to his home village of Vadamanappakkam. Then, in 2005, four students working under Dr. Srivatsan at the time – Grant Lee, Ravi Menghani, Aswin Sekar and Daniel Choi – showed interest in starting a nonprofit doing work in rural India. They collaborated with Srivatsan to begin Project RISHI, and Srivatsan provided the necessary ties that the students needed with the village to work with them directly.

SRIVATSAN 4: When Grant and Ravi said “Where do we start?,” I said I don't know what to do. But I knew the village needs it. Now we've come a long way, from 2005 to 2015. The restrooms in the village, there’s a playground, there (are) restrooms for women, a clinic, every three days a week, senior physician comes around, medication comes from Chennai free of cost to villagers.

MEHTA 6: Project RISHI continues to implement new projects, and as mentioned earlier, the hand-washing demonstration was one of them this year. But in order to come to the conclusion that a demo would be needed, RISHI learned from past attempts to address hygiene. Co-President Suruchi Salgar was unable to make this year's trip due to unforeseen circumstances, but visited the village last year with her peers. 

SALGAR 1: There was one issue with one of our projects, we realized, with the soap project. What happened was, we were giving kids soap in schools because a lot of people couldn’t afford it, and then we found out that a lot of kids were like selling the soap and buying candy with their money, which is like, adorable but also kind of problematic at the same time. And it never came out, you know, in all the talks with the teachers and the principals over the phone, but sort of once you’re there, you realize things like this happen... 

MEHTA 7: Salgar brings up an issue that nonprofit work often raises. In trying to introduce new resources to a community with age-old traditions, external organizations do not only face resistance to change, but also innocent incidents – such as the one Salgar described – actually become problematic in the long run. Professor Robert Spich, spoke to me over Skype about the difficulty surrounding the introduction of ideas like hand-washing in a rural village.

SPICH 1: Can you imagine if they sold us cell phones and they never told us how they work? Obviously products need to be explained. And of course, parents are very concerned about health of their children around the world. There is no country in the world, really, where parents don’t care about the health of their kids. So if you understand who has a stake in the use of a soap that you sell, or an idea that you teach, you educate around the importance of this issue. You know, you really have to have a bigger picture to attribute better use to larger things. If your children are less sick for example, less sickness means you get to go to school and get a free meal, or you get a free book or something else you want. You show them that it’s related to a larger set of outcomes both that they value, and the society values. 

MEHTA 8: Though RISHI had to stop distributing soaps, they attempted a new approach to the same problem. Instead of distributing more soaps, the first set of UCLA students who visited the village performed an educational skit based on hand-washing to raise awareness about the diseases that can result from lack of hygiene. 

REDDY 1: We want to do something that is maintained and self-sufficient. Next year, we want to do more education programs about hygiene and cleanliness...

MEHTA 9: Archana Reddy, co-president of Project RISHI, and her fellow members found that education is a major component of sustainable development. While education in the context of introducing change to a community, such as with the introduction of soaps, is vital in implementing long-lasting change, access to education is another focus of this group.

REDDY 2:  I think a big focus right now would just be the educational aspect because a lot of the students right now, it’s gonna be very cyclical if like, they’re not like getting the ability to, like if they’re still in the same system, and still going to the same school, and they don’t end up working, there’s no contribution to the village... 

MEHTA 10: While education in the village has improved, it is still a serious underlying issue that prevents young students from pursuing a college degree and getting a well-paying job. This is a major focus of RISHI’s efforts, as we will see later. 

In the next episode, we look at one of Project RISHI’s current initiatives and how its follow-up work played out during its visit to Vadamanappakkam this summer.
